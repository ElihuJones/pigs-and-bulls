Pigs and Bulls

Description
-----------

This project is for the game: Pigs and Bulls. This game stems from a code breaking game usually played on paper and pencil between two players. In this game the user attempts to decypher an isogram[^1] with a limited number of turns.

In a console, the players each write a 5 character secret word. The characters must all be different. Then, in turn, the players attempt to guess their opponent's word and the program gives the number of matches.
1. Correctly guessed letter of main word is a Pig.
2. Correctly guessed letter of main word is also correctly positioned is a Bull.
The player wins when the guessed letters match with the secret word: every character is a Bull.
