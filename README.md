# Team Project

Description
-----------

This project is for the game: Pigs and Bulls. Pigs and Bulls stems from a code breaking game usually played on paper and pencil between two players. In this game the user attempts to decypher an isogram[^1] with a limited number of turns.

In a console, the players each write a 5 character secret word. The characters must all be different. Then, in turn, the players attempt to guess their opponent's number and the program gives the number of matches until the word is found or the player runs out of turns.
1. A correctly guessed letter of the secret word is a Pig.
2. A Correctly guessed letter of the secret word that is also correctly positioned is a Bull.
The player wins when the guessed letters are all bulls: the guess matches the secret.
